==========================
The Student Enrollment System is a web application developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework utilized for layout and forms. The system allows users to enroll new students by filling out a form with various fields, and it incorporates comprehensive validations to ensure accurate data entry. Upon submission of the enrollment form, the student's information is dynamically added to a table, and images submitted via URLs are loaded onto the webpage. Furthermore, clicking on the website link provided in the form opens the link in a new tab. The enrollment process is enriched with a visually appealing fade-in effect achieved through CSS animations.

Key Features:

1.User-Friendly Enrollment Form: The web application features a user-friendly enrollment form designed using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap, ensuring an intuitive and responsive interface for users on all devices and screen sizes.

2.Comprehensive Field Validations: All fields in the enrollment form are equipped with necessary validations, ensuring that users provide accurate and complete information. On validation failure, informative error messages guide users to correct their input.

3.Dynamic Table Population: Upon successful form submission, the enrolled student's information is dynamically added to a table on the webpage, providing a clear overview of all enrolled students.

4.Image Loading from URL: Students can submit a URL that points to their image, and the system loads the image onto the webpage, enhancing the visual appeal of the enrollment table.

5.Website Link Handling: The system allows students to include a website link in the form. When clicked, the link opens in a new browser tab, providing easy access to additional information.

6.CSS Animation for Visual Appeal: Each new enrollment added to the table is presented with a subtle fade-in effect using CSS animations, creating an aesthetically pleasing user experience.

7.Responsive Design: The web application is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it adapts seamlessly to various resolutions and screen sizes, enabling users to access and use the system on different devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
